# plugin-histogram-button-response

## Overview

The `histogram-button-response` plugin displays a histogram chart and records responses generated by a button click. The chart is displayed until a response is given. The button itself can be customized using HTML formatting.

The histogram stimulus is generated from a numeric array of data, with optional parameters for setting the number of bins to use. You can also add an annotation to the chart by setting the bin corresponding to a particular score as a different colour, with a corresponding text annotation.

This plugin uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) under the hood, and supports features like axis labeling, legend display, and percentage formatting on the y-axis.
