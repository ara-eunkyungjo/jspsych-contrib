# plugin-densitychart-button-response

## Overview

The `densitychart-button-response` plugin displays a density plot chart and records responses generated by a button click. The chart can be displayed until a response is given, or for a pre-determined amount of time. The button itself can be customized using HTML formatting.

The density plot stimulus is generated from a numeric array of data, with optional parameters for customizing how smooth the densities are and the colours used. You can also add an annotation to the chart indicated by a vertical line with an accompanying text annotation.

This plugin uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) under the hood, and supports features like axis labeling, legend display, and percentage formatting on the y-axis.
