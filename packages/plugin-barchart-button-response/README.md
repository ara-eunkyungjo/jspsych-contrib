# plugin-barchart-button-response

## Overview

The `barchart-button-response` plugin displays a bar chart and records responses generated by a button click. The chart is displayed until a response is given. The buttons themselves can be customized using HTML formatting.

The bar chart stimulus is generated from an array of objects, where each object should contain a numeric `value` (used for the y-axis) and a string `key` (used for the x-axis label). One of the bars can optionally be highlighted in a distinct color and annotated with a text label.

This plugin uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) under the hood, and supports features like axis labeling, legend display, and percentage formatting on the y-axis.
